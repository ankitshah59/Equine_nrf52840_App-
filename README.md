# Equine_nrf52840_App-
Python App to get multi sensor data from multiples devices and real time customizable graphs. The app is intended for collecting real time sensor data from farm horses while being monitored for regular health screening and exercise. The custom made device sends the data for additional ML based approaches.

# üêé HORSE SENSOR DESKTOP APP

## Overview
This repository provides a **desktop application** for real-time monitoring of equine physiological signals using **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors**. The system was developed as part of the research project:

üìÑ *"Wearable Smart Textile Band for Continuous Equine Health Monitoring"* 
The application supports:
- Continuous data acquisition from multiple BLE-enabled sensors  
- Real-time visualization of physiological parameters (respiration, cardiac activity, movement)  
- Event logging with timestamped snapshots  
- Adjustable time windowing for signal inspection  
- Data export to `.txt` logs for further analysis  

This work bridges veterinary medicine and biomedical engineering, enabling **wireless, non-invasive, and continuous equine health monitoring** in both clinical and field environments.
